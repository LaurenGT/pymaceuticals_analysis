# Analysis of Drug Treatments on Tumors in Mice

Based on the analysis included in the .ipnyb file included, three observations that can be made are as follows:

1. Of the ten treatment regimens (including placebo), Capomulin and Ramicane regimens return the most consistent results based on the statistical values of varienace, standard deviation and SEM as well as the small differences between their mean and median.
2. These two treatments additionally have the smallest average tumor volumes as well as final tumor volumes of the mice treated with these drugs.
3. Focusing in on Capomulin, there is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
